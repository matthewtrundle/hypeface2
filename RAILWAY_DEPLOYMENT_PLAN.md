## üöÇ Step 4: Deploy to Railway

### 4.1 Initial Deploy
```bash
# Deploy from CLI
railway up

# OR let auto-deploy handle it after GitHub push
git push origin main
```

### 4.2 Monitor Deployment
```bash
# Watch logs
railway logs -f

# Check deployment status
railway status
```

### 4.3 Run Database Setup
```bash
# After first deployment, run migrations
railway run npx prisma migrate deploy --schema=apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma

# Create test user
railway run npx prisma db seed --schema=apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma
```

---

## ‚úÖ Step 5: Verify Deployment

### 5.1 Check Health Endpoint
```bash
# Get your Railway URL
railway open

# Test health endpoint
curl https://your-app.railway.app/health

# Expected response:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-13T...",
  "services": {
    "database": true,
    "redis": true
  }
}
```

### 5.2 Test Login
1. Open: `https://your-app.railway.app`
2. Login with test credentials:
   - Email: `test@example.com`
   - Password: `testpassword`

---

## üì° Step 6: Configure TradingView Webhooks

### 6.1 Create Alert in TradingView
1. Open TradingView chart
2. Create alert with your strategy
3. In "Webhook URL" field, enter:
   ```
   https://your-app.railway.app/webhooks/tradingview
   ```

### 6.2 Configure Message Format
```json
{
  "action": "{{strategy.order.action}}",
  "symbol": "{{ticker}}",
  "strategy": "{{strategy.name}}",
  "timestamp": {{timenow}}
}
```

### 6.3 Add Webhook Headers
```
X-Webhook-Secret: your-webhook-secret-from-env
X-Webhook-Timestamp: {{timenow}}
```

---

## üß™ Step 7: Test the Bot

### 7.1 Test with Mock Webhook
```bash
# SSH into Railway
railway run bash

# Run test webhook
curl -X POST https://your-app.railway.app/webhooks/test \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action": "buy", "symbol": "BTC-USD", "strategy": "test"}'
```

### 7.2 Monitor Logs

# Monitor database size
railway run npx prisma studio
```

### 10.2 Regular Maintenance
```bash
# Weekly: Check logs for errors
railway logs --since 7d | grep -E "error|failed"

# Monthly: Database cleanup
railway run npx prisma db execute --schema=apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma \
  --command "DELETE FROM system_logs WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'"

# Backup database
railway run pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
```

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Database Connection Failed
```bash
# Check DATABASE_URL
railway variables

# Test connection
railway run npx prisma db pull --schema=apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma
```

#### Build Failures
```bash
# Clear cache and rebuild
railway up --no-cache

# Check build logs
railway logs --build
```

#### WebSocket Not Connecting
```bash
# Verify environment variables
railway run env | grep WS_URL

# Check CORS settings
railway run cat apps/api/src/app.ts | grep FRONTEND_URL
```

---

## üéØ Quick Deploy Commands

```bash
# Complete deployment from scratch
git clone https://github.com/matthewtrundle/hype.git
cd hype
railway login
railway init
railway up

# After deployment
railway run npm run db:migrate
railway run npm run db:seed
railway open
```

## üìù SQL Commands for Manual Database Setup

If you need to manually set up the database:

```sql
-- Create database (if not auto-created)
CREATE DATABASE hyperliquid_bot;

-- Connect to database
\c hyperliquid_bot;

-- Run Prisma migrations
-- This is handled by: railway run npm run db:migrate

-- Verify tables created
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public';

-- Check for test user
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'test@example.com';

-- Monitor recent trades
SELECT * FROM trades ORDER BY executed_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Check open positions
SELECT * FROM positions WHERE status = 'open';

-- View system health
SELECT * FROM system_logs
WHERE level = 'error'
AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
```
