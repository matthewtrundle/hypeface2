# Railway Deployment Guide - OPTIMIZED

This project is **fully optimized** for Railway deployment with automatic database provisioning, health checks, and production-ready configuration.

## üöÄ One-Click Deploy

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/template/deploy)

## üìã Prerequisites

1. Railway account (https://railway.app)
2. Railway CLI installed: `npm install -g @railway/cli`
3. GitHub repository with your code

## üîß Railway Setup Steps

### 1. Create New Project

```bash
# Login to Railway
railway login

# Create new project
railway init

# Link to existing project (if needed)
railway link
```

### 2. Provision Services

Railway will automatically detect and provision:
- **PostgreSQL** database
- **Redis** instance
- **Web** service (API)
- **Worker** service (Trading Engine)

Or manually add via Dashboard:
1. Click "New Service"
2. Select PostgreSQL
3. Click "New Service"
4. Select Redis

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

In Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Variables:

```env
# Database (Auto-provided by Railway)
DATABASE_URL=${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}
REDIS_URL=${{Redis.REDIS_URL}}

# Security (MUST CHANGE!)
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-min-32-chars
MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-32-character-encryption-key-change-this
WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-webhook-secret-from-tradingview

# Hyperliquid - START WITH TESTNET
HYPERLIQUID_API_URL=https://api.hyperliquid-testnet.xyz
HYPERLIQUID_MAINNET_URL=https://api.hyperliquid.xyz

# Wallet (Generate new for production!)
WALLET_PUBLIC_KEY=0x...your-wallet-address
WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=encrypted-private-key-here

# Trading Config
POSITION_SIZE_PERCENTAGE=10
MAX_LEVERAGE=10
STOP_LOSS_PERCENTAGE=5
TAKE_PROFIT_PERCENTAGE=10

# Frontend URL (Railway provides)
FRONTEND_URL=https://${{RAILWAY_STATIC_URL}}
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://${{RAILWAY_STATIC_URL}}
NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=wss://${{RAILWAY_STATIC_URL}}

# Monitoring
LOG_LEVEL=info
NODE_ENV=production
```

### 4. Deploy from GitHub

Connect GitHub repo in Railway:
1. Settings ‚Üí GitHub
2. Connect repository
3. Select branch (main/master)
4. Enable automatic deploys

### 5. Deploy from CLI

```bash
# Deploy current directory
railway up

# Deploy with specific environment
railway up --environment production

# View deployment logs
railway logs

# Open deployed app
railway open
```

## üö® Production Checklist

### Before Deploy:
- [ ] Generate NEW wallet for production
- [ ] Set strong JWT_SECRET (32+ chars)
- [ ] Set unique MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY
- [ ] Configure TradingView webhook secret
- [ ] Test on Hyperliquid testnet first

### After Deploy:
- [ ] Run database migrations: `railway run npm run db:migrate`
- [ ] Seed initial data: `railway run npm run db:seed`
- [ ] Test health endpoint: `https://your-app.railway.app/health`
- [ ] Test webhook endpoint
- [ ] Monitor logs: `railway logs -f`

## üîß Optimizations for Railway

### 1. **Database Migrations**
Automatically runs on deploy via start command

### 2. **Health Checks**
- Endpoint: `/health`
- Checks: Database, Redis, API
- Auto-restart on failure

### 3. **Resource Optimization**
- Build caching enabled
- Node modules cached
- Prisma client pre-generated

### 4. **Environment Detection**
- Automatic production mode
- Railway-specific URLs used
- SSL/TLS handled by Railway

### 5. **Logging**
- Structured JSON logs
- Error tracking ready
- Log levels by environment

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Build Failures
```bash
# Check build logs
railway logs --build

# Clear cache and rebuild
railway up --no-cache
```

### Database Issues
