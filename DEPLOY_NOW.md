# üöÄ DEPLOY NOW - Quick Railway Deployment

## Option 1: Automated Script (Easiest)

I've created a complete deployment script that handles everything:

```bash
# Run the automated deployment script
./deploy-to-railway.sh
```

This script will:
1. ‚úÖ Install Railway CLI if needed
2. ‚úÖ Login to Railway
3. ‚úÖ Create project
4. ‚úÖ Generate security keys
5. ‚úÖ Create test wallet
6. ‚úÖ Deploy to Amsterdam (EU)
7. ‚úÖ Provide all commands needed

## Option 2: Manual Steps (If Script Doesn't Work)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Railway CLI

```bash
# macOS/Linux/Windows (via npm)
npm install -g @railway/cli

# macOS (via Homebrew)
brew install railway

# Or via curl
curl -fsSL https://railway.app/install.sh | sh
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Login & Create Project

```bash
# Login (opens browser)
railway login

# Create new project
railway init

# Choose project name: hyperliquid-trading-bot
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy to Railway (Amsterdam)

```bash
# Deploy to EU (avoids US restrictions)
railway up --region eu-west1
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Add Database Services

Go to Railway Dashboard:
1. Click "New Service" ‚Üí "Database" ‚Üí "PostgreSQL"
2. Click "New Service" ‚Üí "Database" ‚Üí "Redis"

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Set Environment Variables

In Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Variables tab, add:

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Run Database Migrations

```bash

## üÜò Quick Troubleshooting

### If Railway CLI won't install:
```bash
# Try with sudo
sudo npm install -g @railway/cli

# Or use npx instead
npx @railway/cli login
```

### If deployment fails:
```bash
# Check logs
railway logs --build

# Clear and retry
railway up --no-cache
```

### If database won't connect:
```bash
# Check environment variables
railway variables

# DATABASE_URL and REDIS_URL should be auto-set
```
